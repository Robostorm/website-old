And such, the Aquabot was born. We an old powered wheelchair donated to us, and we added remote controls and a cooler with a dispenser and bill acceptor.\n\n\nDrive Controls\n\n\nThe first thing we did with the wheelchair was to figure out how to get it to move. The original electronics required a key, and we did not have the charger. We decided instead to rip them out, and add our own. We wanted the Aquabot to be completly safe, so we put a bumper on the front, along with an emergency stop button, that completly disabled movement when hit. The only way to renable it was with either a key or to open the electronics box and flip a switch. We found a nice motor controller to control both motors, and could take inputs directly from the hobby reciever that we were using for remote control. We later added a microcontroller between the reciever and the motor controller in order to smooth out the controls and use a button on the remote as a driving enable.\n\n\nDispenser and Bill Acceptor\n\n\nThe first version of the cooler used a Lego Mindstorms to accept bills and dispense water. It could only hold a few bottles at a time, and would not always dispense reliably. We then decided to replace it with a 3d printed dispenser that was smaller, more reliable, and could hold more bottles. At the same time, the Lego bill acceptor was replaced with a bill acceptor from an old vending machine. To control the new dispenser and bill acceptor, the Lego Mindstorms was replaced with a \nTeensy++ 2.0\n on a custom control board. We also added an LCD and keypad to show bottles left, sold, and allow some configuration. We also added some LED strips around the Aquabot, just for the intense lighting at night.

This kit was chosen because some of the members had built one on their own time, and could help other members putting it together. Once it was build, we rotated the printed between members, so whoever wanted to print something could. After building the club printer, many members wanted their own. They bought the same kit, and used their experience from building the club printer to build their own.\n\n\nNametag Printing at the Fair\n\n\n\n\nWith so many members that had their own printers, we needed something for them all to do at the fair. As a way to make some money at it, we came up with the idea of printing custom nametags for fairgoers, for only a dollar each. In order to do this, we needed an automated system to take names, generate the nametag, prepare it for printing, and print it on the printers. To make printing to the printers easier, we set up each printer with a \nRaspberry Pi\n running \nOctoprint\n. This allowed an easy was to a central server to print to each of the printers, without needing to be directly connected to each one.\n\n\nThe Original Nametag System\n\n\nThe server to collect and print the nametags has benn revised many times since it's initial release. The one used for the first fair we did nametags was based off a Java Tomcat server, and worked reasonably well. Unfortunatly, it began to have issues crashing, printing nametags twice, and other issues. The member that wrote it was leaving the club the year after, and no one else wanted to try and fix it. \n\n\nThe Second Nametag System\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsecond version\n was then written from scratch in the Go language by another member, trying to make it as bulletproof as possible. It got an initial test run at the Maker Day that the club participated in during the spring, allowing a full test before the fair. After some final modifications, it was used at the fair to print to all of the five printers there, and worked great. It never crashed, printed each nametag only once, and did everything it was supposed to.",
